# Create our own Chatbot

# 1. Greet the user with a predetermined statement
greeting = "Hello! I am a chatbot."

# 2. Print the statement
print(greeting)

# 3. Introduce the bot
print("My name is MeGPT.")
print("I'm not like the other chatbots.")
print("I'm completely deterministic.")

# 3. Wow the user with some maths
print("I bet you don't know what 8*8 is")
print("I can do it")
print(f"8*8 is actually {8 * 8} ")

print("What is pi squared?")
print("I'm smart and can do it")
print(f"It is {3.141592653**2}")

# 4. Get the name of the user and store it.
user_name = input("So... what's your name? ")
print(f"It's nice to meet you,{user_name}.")

# 5. Ask the user 3 questions.
favourite_colour = input("What's your favourite colour!")
print(f"{favourite_colour}?! That's my favourite colour too!")

movie = input("What's your favourite Halloween Movie?")
print(f"You have a great taste in movies, {user_name}!")

favourite_season = input("What's your favourite season?")
print(f"{favourite_season} is a solid choice!")
